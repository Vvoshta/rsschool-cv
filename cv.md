### Briefly About Myself:
I began my career as a layout designer at a local newspaper, starting with minimal skills. This experience was crucial in developing the necessary skills for my journey into frontend development. Additionally, I worked as a photographer assistant for three years, which greatly enhanced my design and retouching abilities. Through this role, I became proficient in various retouching techniques, learned to utilize graphic devices, and became an advanced user of Photoshop. This eventually led me to getting my first job as a freelance retoucher.

Working remotely as a retoucher has provided me with extra free time, which I have dedicated to learning frontend development. I'm particularly interested in web development due to its vast potential for professional growth. Furthermore, there is an abundance of high-quality resources available for self-education in this field, along with a large community of developers.

I firmly believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will guide me towards becoming a skilled Frontend Developer.
